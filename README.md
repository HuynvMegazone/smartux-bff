## Hexagonal Architecture
The hierarchical architecture is the most traditional and famous architecture mentioned along with DDD.

As the name suggests, it is a multi-layered structure.

A hierarchical architecture consists of four layers:

- Presentation (= UI) layer
    - Where interfaces and applications connect
    - Display of output and interpretation of input
    - Mainly responsible for communication and input/output conversion such as web communication framework and CLI interface.
- application layer
    - It is a direct client of the domain object and is where the objects implementing the use case come together.
    - Application services belong here.
- domain layer
    - Where domain-related objects come together
    - Domain models (entities, value objects), domain services, etc.
    - The repository interface also falls into this category.
- infrastructure layer
    - A place where objects with a technological foundation that support different hierarchies come together.
    - This includes implementation classes such as ORMs, in-memory, etc. that implement repositories.

Now look at the diagram above again and you will understand.
The important point is that the <b>dependency direction is from top to bottom (presentation -> application -> domain). Reliance contrary to this direction is not permitted.</b> (Domain -> infrastructure is not a dependency relationship, but abstraction -> implementation relationship is common. In the diagram above, you can see an arrow where the domain depends on the infrastructure, but it is said that it is not a frequently used pattern at present.)
